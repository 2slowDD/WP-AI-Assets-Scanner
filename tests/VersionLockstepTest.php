/**
 * FU-H — the shipped version lives in THREE places that must move together.
 *
 *   1. dr-speed-ai-assets-scanner.php   plugin header      ` * Version:     <v>`
 *   2. dr-speed-ai-assets-scanner.php   `define( 'DRSPEED_AIAS_VERSION', '<v>' )`
 *   3. README.md               shields.io badge   `![Version](.../VERSION-<v>-<hex>?...)`
 *
 * The badge is the one that drifts: it is a static literal inside a URL, so nothing in
 * the release flow touches it and a version bump that edits (1) and (2) leaves it stale.
 * The repo has shipped that drift before (memory: "README shields.io VERSION badge is a
 * static literal the version bump MISSES").
 *
 * ⛔ This test deliberately does NOT read the DRSPEED_AIAS_VERSION *constant*.
 * tests/bootstrap.php defines it as '1.0.0' before the plugin file is ever parsed, so a
 * constant-reading assertion sees the shadow, never the shipped value, and is green for
 * every possible state of the three files. That shadow is exactly why the suite was blind
 * to this class of drift. All three values below are read as FILE TEXT.
 *
 * Anchors are matched by CONTENT, never by line number — the three sites move.
 * Each pattern must match EXACTLY ONCE: a second copy of a version literal is itself a
 * new drift surface, so "two matches" fails as loudly as "no match".
