// B4 — close the same-version JS drift class.
//
// THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR, measured: b743c1c bumped the plugin to 1.7.94b, then ELEVEN more
// commits landed on origin/main — three of them user-visible — with no further bump. Every
// admin JS file is enqueued at ?ver=AIAS_VERSION, so two builds both calling themselves
// "1.7.94b" differed visibly in the browser and WordPress could offer no update between them.
// Only the operator noticing caught it, and it cost a full diagnostic cycle.
//
// A second instance of the same class was found on 2026-08-16: SCANNER_JS_VERSION, the console
// banner used to tell WHICH JS build a browser actually loaded, had been stuck at 1.0.10.29
// since 1.7.63b while five commits changed scanner.js underneath it. The one instrument for
// diagnosing the drift had drifted.
//
// THE GUARD IS INVERTED, deliberately — the same shape as SecretFixtureAllowlistTest. It does
// not try to detect "changed since last commit"; it pins a FINGERPRINT per released version.
// Edit any admin JS and the pin for the current version stops matching, so the suite reds until
// the version is bumped and a NEW row is added.
//
// ⛔ DO NOT "fix" a red by rewriting an existing row's hash. Each row is the fingerprint of a
// build that already shipped under that version string; rewriting one asserts that a released
// build was something other than what it was, and re-opens exactly the hole this closes. The
// correct fix is always: bump the version, add a row.
//
// ⚠️ SCOPE — the bump rule is narrower than it looks. Bump when admin/, includes/, or the root
// plugin files change. Do NOT bump for tests/, releases/, or tooling config: build-release.py's
// TOP_FILES/TOP_DIRS whitelist excludes them, so they never reach a customer, and bumping for a
// repo-only change ships two version numbers with a byte-identical ZIP — the mirror image of the
// bug above. This guard only watches admin/js, so it cannot fire on a tests-only change.
