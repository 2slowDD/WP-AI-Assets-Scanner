 * The ONE class→file autoload map.

 * Was duplicated as an inline array in dr-speed-ai-assets-scanner.php AND tests/bootstrap.php.
 * Both are hand-maintained, so a new class registered in one and forgotten in the other
 * leaves the whole suite green while a live site fatals on first use — the test map is
 * an injected activation path; this file makes both consumers load the real one (P17).
 *
 * Paths are relative to AIAS_DIR.
